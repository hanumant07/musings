/*
 * At an open-source fair held at a major university,
 * leaders of open-source projects put sign-up
 * sheets on the wall, with the project name at the
 * top in capital letters for identification.
 * Students then signed up for projects using
 * their userids. A userid is a string of lower-case
 * letters and numbers starting with a letter.
 * The organizer then took all the sheets off the
 * wall and typed in the information.
 * Your job is to summarize the number of
 * students who have signed up for each project.
 * Some students were overly enthusiastic and put
 * their name down several times for the same
 * project. Thatâ€™s okay, but they should only count
 * once. Students were asked to commit to a single
 * project, so any student who has signed up for more than one project should
 * not count for any project.
 * There are at most 10,000 students at the university, and at most 100 projects
 * were advertised.
 *
 * Input
 * The input contains several test cases, each one ending with a line that
 * starts with the digit 1. The last
 * test case is followed by a line starting with the digit 0.
 * Each test case consists of one or more project sheets. A project sheet
 * consists of a line containing
 * the project name in capital letters, followed by the userids of students, one
 * per line.
 * Output
 * For each test case, output a summary of each project sheet. The summary is
 * one line with the name
 * of the project followed by the number of students who signed up. These lines
 * should be printed in
 * decreasing order of number of signups. If two or more projects have the same
 * number of signups, they
 * should be listed in alphabetical order
