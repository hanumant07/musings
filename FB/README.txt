			Sensor parser
			=============

About:
=====

Software provides a tool for parsing 12 bit sensor values stored in a binary
file. It generates an output file containing the 32 highet values and the
last 32 values.
The implementation is optimized for a low memory footprint.


Algorithm:
==========

The implementation uses O(1) extra memory.

a) Parsing values from input
	Values are read 3 bytes at a time. This should correspond to 2, 12 bit
	values. After performing appropriate bit operations values are unpacked

a) Tracking last 32 values
	This is achieved by implementing a circular buffer of 32 entries.
	As a new value is encountered it is inserted in its appropriate location.
	While flushing the circular buffer to output, the values are written oldest
	to most recent.

	Extra Memory: Only 32 entry array

b) Tracking max 32 values
	This is achieved by maintaining a min heap of 32 entries.
	A min heap is a binary tree with a property, that for every node other
	than the root, the value of the node is greater than that of its parent.
	This implies that the root of the tree has a minimum value.
	Retrieving the minimum value is done O(1) time.
	Inserting a new value takes O(lgn).

	1) The first 32 values are recorded as is.
	2) Once 32 values are recorded, a min heap is constructed.
	3) Every new incoming value is compared with the minimum value.
	   If its greater, the minimum value is swapped with the new value.
	4) This swap destroys the heap property described above. We repair it
	   in O(lgn) time to bring the new minimum value back to the root.
	5) While writing to output, we perform heapsort on the heap O(nlgn)
	   and write the values to the output file.

	Extra Memory: Only 32 entry array

Usage:
======
	Build and use Parser Tool:
	==========================
	(Validated on a Ubuntu 14.04 and iMac)

	1) From root directory 
	   $source scripts/setup.sh 

	2) $cd src
	   $make 
	   (This will generate the parser binary)

	2) $cd ../scripts
	   $./invoke_parser -i <input_file> -o <output_file> 
	
	(You may need to make invoke_parser script executable
		chmod 777 invoke_parser.sh)

Testing
=======
	Source tree includes a testing tool (test_parser.c)
	This provides user options to 
	
	1. test heap implementation
	2. generate sample input and output files to test the parser tool.
	   Simply use the sample_input.bin generated by the tool as input
	   for the parser. Compare the output with sample_out.txt

	The implementation uses a random number generator for generating
	the test data. It uses a library sort (qsort) to compare sorted
	data with the parser output.
	
	Build and usage of Testing tool:
	===============================
	(Validated on a Ubuntu 14.04 and an iMac)

	1) From root directory
	   $source scripts/setup.sh

	2) $cd src
	   $make clean (Needed in case parser was generated previously)
	   $make TOOL=test
	   $make TOOL=test install
	
	3) $cd ../tests
	   $./test_parser
